# Day Planner
The Day Planner is a simple web application that allows you to plan and save your tasks for specific time slots during the day. In this example, we'll focus on creating a day planner for the hours of 9am, 10am, and 11am, and saving the tasks to the browser's local storage.

## Features
Displays a day planner interface with three time slots: 9am, 10am, and 11am.
Allows you to enter and save tasks for each time slot.
Persists the entered tasks in the browser's local storage, so they are retained even if you refresh the page or close the browser.
Prerequisites
To run the Day Planner, you need a web browser with JavaScript enabled.

## Installation
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Usage
When the Day Planner is loaded, you'll see a simple interface displaying the time slots for 9am, 10am, and 11am.
Click on a time slot to enter a task for that specific hour.
After entering the task, click outside the input field to save it.
The task will be displayed below the time slot.
You can edit or update the task by clicking on it.
To delete a task, simply clear the text in the input field and save it.
The entered tasks will be automatically saved to the browser's local storage, so you can close the page or refresh it without losing your data.
